# HSSP Introductory Python Programming through Games

This is a repository that holds the code for the Summer 2018 intro to python programming for MIT's HSSP program.

This code was developed for [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 2.7).

Running the game templates and game example relies on the [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) library (version 1.9.3) which can be downloaded [here](https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml).

If you are looking to program without having to install Python on your computer, we recommend using the [www.learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/) which is an interactive tutorial that covers many of the same topics as we will in the course.
